# Profile Website
### By trojanface

## Description
This is my portfolio website giving a brief explanation of who I am, an overview of the projects I've worked on and how to contact me if you want to work together. It is a responsive layout that adapts to any screen size and features a vertical menu on desktop, a sticky footer that resizes on all screens and responsive images.
